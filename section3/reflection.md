## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

 * I feel like things are taking a long time to figure out and get perfect.  I am reaching out for help after 15 minutes, googling, and figuring things out but I fear the pace of class will feel super fast and I am nervous about it.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

 * Spotify!  There are tons of arrays.  Genres of music, genres of artists, genres of music by year and geography.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* An array is used to store multiple elements or vaules in a single variable.
  ex: var cars = ["Honda", "Toyota", "Jeep"];  Arrays indexes are zero-based meaning that the first element
  in the array is 0 and the second is 1.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* If we wanted to console.log something 5 times, we would literally have to write it five times, but we can control this much better with a loop.  Loops allow you to log multiple conditions whithout having to write out every single condition.

* You would use an array if you want the computer to spit out a message to the user.  If you want the computer to spit out just a number, there is no need for an array.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* Let's say you have to clear your plate for family dinner.  You have to clear your plate and take it to the dishwasher.  But what if you have a family of 10?  That would take you a long time and you would have to repeat that task 10 times.  If you wanted your robot friend to do all the dishes, you couldn't just say "clean all the dishes", its not specific enough!  You would have to tell the robot the same exact instructions 10 times.  Fortunately, there is a way to tell a computer to repeat an action without having to repeat your command (code).  This is called a loop.  Loops allow us to use one command to repeat the same process multiple time and complete the same task.  

Typing out the same code over and over takes time and you are more likely to make mistakes.  Make your code shorter to save time! Yay!

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

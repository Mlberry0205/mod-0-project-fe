## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1. By Believing you can improve coding skills with practice and repetition, having a growth mindset is associated with more mastery
2. S.M.A.R.T Goals: Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound.  This strategy by Rubin helps the approach of     learning code.
3. Fix mindset Vs. Growth Mindset
**Fixed**: Your capabilities are fixed.  How you were born and how you are now is it.
**Growth**:  What you are now is what you are now but you can always grow on that.  What you will be today will be someone different tomorrow.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* I am a visual learner.  Code is all visual.  What I need to continue to learn is that errors are not necessarily a bad thing.  Computers will do exactly what we tell them to do.  Therefore, if there is 1 thing missing, we have to change/fix that.  And that’s OK!  By striving to improve, we will get the right answer eventually.  Focus on the process and not always the result.
* If I struggle, maybe I won’t have it or ever get it.  
* Everybody does things at their own speed.  Do not compare yourself to others.  As long as you are going, that is the most important.


3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

* It forced the viewer to either 1) Go back and look for the answer or 2) Know the answer.  I felt more inclined to memorize the answer after I had to go back and look as I didn't want to keep having to go back.  I feel a bit frustrated with having to go back as I am so brand new at learning everything that everything takes extra time but it also forced me to use the terminal to open section1 back up which is helpful to keep doing over and over again.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

--if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}

--“if, else if, else.”

--"if the condition returns true, run code A, else run code B"

--Conditionals are statements that only run when certain criteria are met.

--A conditional statement tells a program to execute different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.

--If you do your homework, than you will get a good grade.  If you do not do your homework, (else) you will fail.

-- Video games.  If you win this level than...else if you lose than...

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

* A conditional statement tells a computer what to do, if a certain condition is true.  If a certain condition is false, then it does something else and so on.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

* You can use the logical operators (AND) and (OR).
* AND = &&  Returns true if both operands are trouble
* OR = ||   Returns true if either operand is true


7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

* When to use === vs the double == and the !== vs the !=

## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  I feel like I am somewhere in between.  I try to allow myself to "struggle" a bit to try and figure out the problem.  I have not found Google useful yet, but I think that is just because I am still learning how to ask Google the correct questions.  I do like using YouTube as I am a very visual person.  I am am finding that I feel very lost at the beginning of a new assignment.  I have tons of questions.  I try to break down problems step by step as to not get overwhelmed.  With practice and repetition come skills.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  Number Data Type:  All numbers (including negative numbers).  Large numbers have NO commas.
  Integers: Numbers that have decimals behind it.

  Var num1 = 2745
  Var num2 = -899

  String Data Type: A word or sentence using characters.  We define a string by wrapping double quotes ("Morgan") around the word we want to create.  You can use single or double quotations.  You will receive a "undefined error" if you do not use quotes in Javascript. (Use \ if you want your quotes to show up in your text)

  Var name = "Morgan is learning!"  ===  Morgan is learning!
  Var name = "Morgan \"hello\" Berry"  === Morgan "hello" Berry
  Var number = "7743782874" === 7743782874

Boolean (bool) Data Type: A true or False statement.  In Javascript we do a lot of conditions (Is this the same as this OR is this statement True or False)  

  Var bool1 = true;
  Var bool2 = false;

  10 === 10

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

  console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

  Characters used to indicate a comment in JavaScript: Two backslashes (//)
  Comments can be useful for other developers to understand your code.  When a comment has been initiated with 2 backslashes, the comment will not run as code by JavaScript.  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

  Dynamic websites need to remember information to display or change.  For that reason, JavaScript has variables.  Like moving boxes, variables have content and names that tell us what's inside.  Every variable needs a name that is a single word (no spaces). Use camel case to create a variable with multiple words.  Use descriptive names.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

  I use Instagram and Facebook often.  Perhaps there would be User variables, password variables, comment variables, profile picture variables.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

  A concatenation is when you put two string together to make one long string.  when we use the (+) symbols, our strings come together.

  Var first = "Hello my name is Morgan. "
  Var second = "and this is JavaScript."

  console.log(first + second)

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

  For string that are very long?  To help users find all of the information in 1 place?


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

  1.  Why do developers use concatenation?
  2.  Should developers use interpolation instead of concatenation?
  3.  How many times can you re-assign a value to a variable?
